# Objectives

[Go to navigation](#Navigation)

- Remaster this project using Ren'Py for cross-platform compatibility.

- Utilize AI to enhance the visual quality (720p to 1080p, and some assets to 2K resolution).

- Provide more people with the opportunity to experience and fall in love with this work.

- Ultimately open-source all the Chinese localization results to offer insights for other enthusiasts interested in contributing to the localization effort.

**Preview of the Latest Development Interface**

January 22, 2022 - January 25, 2022

The GUI has been redesigned, and new features have been added, including the ability to load the latest save file, uninterrupted voice playback, history dialogue jumping, volume testing, and more. The save/load interface is now independent, and experimental support for hardware decoding has been introduced.

**WEB Version**

​	The WEB version has already been uploaded, and if you want to try it out, you can visit the [WEB Version Demo Server](https://love69demo.luckykeeper.site/) (the server is located in Moscow, so it's recommended to access it during low-traffic times like early morning Beijing time, as you might encounter issues with access and slow loading at other times).

​	Please note that the WEB version is an experimental feature of Ren'Py, and the actual experience may not be very smooth. Many elements like voice and sound effects may not load correctly. If you encounter pixelation in the images or characters, it's because the corresponding resources haven't been downloaded yet. You can force them to reload by right-clicking with the mouse. Additionally, the content in the WEB version is not synchronized with other versions. The current update date for the WEB version is October 15, 2021.

​	The recommended browsers for the best compatibility are the latest version of Edge, while Chrome's compatibility is slightly lower. Other browsers may not work correctly.

​	If you have the opportunity, it's still better to play the computer or mobile version for a smoother experience~

# Contributions and source code guide

[Go to navigation](#Navigation)

Welcome to help improve this project and learn. Below is a brief introduction on how to get started with ~~the code of this project~~ my nonsense.

(Luckykeeper: First time participating in localization work, not great at Japanese, I handle hosting, programming, artwork, translation, proofreading, editing, and the project team website mostly by myself. I also participate in testing. It's been a lot of hard work, so please be gentle with me 😅)

For discussions, chats, questions, joining in, translation corrections, suggesting improvements, and more, please head over to the Issues: [See existing items](https://github.com/luckykeeper/LOVE69_renpy_remaster/issues); [Create a new post](https://github.com/luckykeeper/LOVE69_renpy_remaster/issues/new).

So, let's get started~

Currently, the project's directory structure is very simple. Under the `images` folder, you'll find the images displayed on this page. The `已完成的文档` (completed documents) folder contains the program's scripts, which include the following files (more files will be added later, but not in the form of new documents):

>Completed Documents
>
>│  OP歌词及翻译.md ——（Lyrics and translation for the opening song, the opening hasn't been done yet）
>

>├─bgm定义 ——（.rpy files are Ren'Py files, don't worry, the syntax is very simple and easy to understand![huaji](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/luckykeeper/LuckyBlog_RS@main/face/huaji.aqdzo604ncs.png))
